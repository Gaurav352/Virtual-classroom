The design of digital filters through the MATLAB function filter to compute averages \nalong a vector of data. The Moving Average filter is widely used in DSP for smoothing \nnoisy data and is one of the easiest of all digital filters to understand. It is particularly \neffective at removing high-frequency random noise from a signal. The moving average \nfilter operates by taking the arithmetic mean, or average value, of a number of past input \nsamples,  in  order  to  form  each  output  sample.    It  slides  a  window  of the  appropriate \nlength, say N.
